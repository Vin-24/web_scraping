       " <span>I'm writing this review after 1 month of use.<br/>Look &amp; feel- premium &amp; satisfying<br/>Display- It has OLED display but not much different than previous LCD display of iPhone XR. BOTH ARE STUNNING &amp; elegant. In fact I liked LCD display more.<br/>Battery life- Excellent. With heavy use of 2+ hrs of Instagram scrolling 1+ hr of YouTube streaming 2+ hrs of listening to music, battery lasts for a whole day. With moderate use for only calling, texting &amp; some surfing it lasts for 1 &amp; 1/2 day.<br/>Camera- amazing shots in daylight. Night mode is great addition. Portrait mode is great in daytime but it doesn't have night mode. Photos loose details after zooming in. Upto 2x zoom is good, after that it's useless.<br/>Ultrawide feature is good but didn't used it much. Front camera is okay, could have been better.<br/>Performance- Ultrafast &amp; smooth. It had heated a lot when moving data from older phone. Heats when used during charging. Fast charger does its job well.<br/>Conclusion- This is a great iPhone but is not a value for money. Overpriced! We can say this about every iPhone. If you are spending this much amount of money you should go for iPhone 12 128GB for about same price but with only 2 snappers which are more than enough. Third snapper in 11 pro doesn't make a difference.<br/>If you are waiting for iPhone 13 to be launched &amp; thinking of buying 12 after price drop, then consider iPhone 11 for now - 2 snappers, LCD display(not much different), bigger than pro, value for money.<br/>Thanks for reading.</span>\n",

       " <span>What I love:<br/>1. Amazing battery life - lasts me 1.5 days from full charge<br/>2. Great speaker quality<br/>3. Superb camera - night mode comes on automatically with the option to control shutter speed<br/>4. Form factor - love the small form factor<br/>5. Superb display<br/>6. Fast charging - so used to this coming from my OnePlus 6T<br/>7. Face ID works flawlessly - the fingerprint scanner in my OP6T didn't work most of the time.<br/><br/>What I don't like:<br/>1. No USB-C - this is a major pain since the supplied charger and earphones only need to be lightning port compatible. Can't use any other charger or earphone. Luckily I have my Sony headphones which I use with Bluetooth<br/>2. Flimsy quality of the charger wire - feels too fragile - should have been metal sheathed and strong.<br/>3. Flimsy quality of the earphone wire<br/>4. Price<br/>5. Lack of good usability of apps - e.g. no way to mark Messages as 'read' from the notifications center. You need to clear the notifications, then go to Messaging app and open each and every message. Considering that most messages are OTPs, etc. this functionality should be a no-brainer.<br/><br/>Overall, I love the phone.</span>\n",

       " <span>Bought this online on 21st October 2019.<br/>Sold by Appario and fulfilled by Amazon. The product dispatch and delivery was prompt. Full marks there.<br/><br/>A year later, I have noticed that the battery performance is unimpressive on two fronts<br/>a) Takes longer to charge than what it should<br/>b) The phone lasts fewer hours (irrespective of whether in use or idle).<br/><br/>The phone-build is commendable and has sustained a few falls.<br/><br/>Clearly the chip design is impressive too. I tested this by using my phone as a hotspot, and performed a speed test. I then moved the SIM card to a router and then performed a speed test. Results were contrasting and clearly in favor of the iphone.<br/><br/>However, these arent reasons good enough to shell out close to 1 lac INR for a phone, if the expected service duration without issues is just about a year.</span>\n",

It took me some time to adjust to the know how of iOS but I can happily say that the switch was worth. This phone is miles ahead of even the flagships introduced in late 2020 or early 2021. The camera is a big improvement on this. My previous phone was pixel 2 XL and this seems to have a improved camera over that.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with the purchase and stick to this for the next 4 years at least as 5G in India is going to be a distant dream when it Comes to being implemented in all cities.</span>\n",

       " <span>I'm writing this review after 1 month of use.<br/>Look &amp; feel- premium &amp; satisfying<br/>Display- It has OLED display but not much different than previous LCD display of iPhone XR. BOTH ARE STUNNING &amp; elegant. In fact I liked LCD display more.<br/>Battery life- Excellent. With heavy use of 2+ hrs of Instagram scrolling 1+ hr of YouTube streaming 2+ hrs of listening to music, battery lasts for a whole day. With moderate use for only calling, texting &amp; some surfing it lasts for 1 &amp; 1/2 day.<br/>Camera- amazing shots in daylight. Night mode is great addition. Portrait mode is great in daytime but it doesn't have night mode. Photos loose details after zooming in. Upto 2x zoom is good, after that it's useless.<br/>Ultrawide feature is good but didn't used it much. Front camera is okay, could have been better.<br/>Performance- Ultrafast &amp; smooth. It had heated a lot when moving data from older phone. Heats when used during charging. Fast charger does its job well.<br/>Conclusion- This is a great iPhone but is not a value for money. Overpriced! We can say this about every iPhone. If you are spending this much amount of money you should go for iPhone 12 128GB for about same price but with only 2 snappers which are more than enough. Third snapper in 11 pro doesn't make a difference.<br/>If you are waiting for iPhone 13 to be launched &amp; thinking of buying 12 after price drop, then consider iPhone 11 for now - 2 snappers, LCD display(not much different), bigger than pro, value for money.<br/>Thanks for reading.</span>\n",

       " <span>What I love:<br/>1. Amazing battery life - lasts me 1.5 days from full charge<br/>2. Great speaker quality<br/>3. Superb camera - night mode comes on automatically with the option to control shutter speed<br/>4. Form factor - love the small form factor<br/>5. Superb display<br/>6. Fast charging - so used to this coming from my OnePlus 6T<br/>7. Face ID works flawlessly - the fingerprint scanner in my OP6T didn't work most of the time.<br/><br/>What I don't like:<br/>1. No USB-C - this is a major pain since the supplied charger and earphones only need to be lightning port compatible. Can't use any other charger or earphone. Luckily I have my Sony headphones which I use with Bluetooth<br/>2. Flimsy quality of the charger wire - feels too fragile - should have been metal sheathed and strong.<br/>3. Flimsy quality of the earphone wire<br/>4. Price<br/>5. Lack of good usability of apps - e.g. no way to mark Messages as 'read' from the notifications center. You need to clear the notifications, then go to Messaging app and open each and every message. Considering that most messages are OTPs, etc. this functionality should be a no-brainer.<br/><br/>Overall, I love the phone.</span>\n",

       " <span>Bought this online on 21st October 2019.<br/>Sold by Appario and fulfilled by Amazon. The product dispatch and delivery was prompt. Full marks there.<br/><br/>A year later, I have noticed that the battery performance is unimpressive on two fronts<br/>a) Takes longer to charge than what it should<br/>b) The phone lasts fewer hours (irrespective of whether in use or idle).<br/><br/>The phone-build is commendable and has sustained a few falls.<br/><br/>Clearly the chip design is impressive too. I tested this by using my phone as a hotspot, and performed a speed test. I then moved the SIM card to a router and then performed a speed test. Results were contrasting and clearly in favor of the iphone.<br/><br/>However, these arent reasons good enough to shell out close to 1 lac INR for a phone, if the expected service duration without issues is just about a year.</span>\n",

It took me some time to adjust to the know how of iOS but I can happily say that the switch was worth. This phone is miles ahead of even the flagships introduced in late 2020 or early 2021. The camera is a big improvement on this. My previous phone was pixel 2 XL and this seems to have a improved camera over that.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with the purchase and stick to this for the next 4 years at least as 5G in India is going to be a distant dream when it Comes to being implemented in all cities.</span>\n",

      "Great iPhone but overpriced.\n",
      "Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 2 April 2021Verified Purchase\n",
      "I'm writing this review after 1 month of use.Look & feel- premium & satisfyingDisplay- It has OLED display but not much different than previous LCD display of iPhone XR. BOTH ARE STUNNING & elegant. In fact I liked LCD display more.Battery life- Excellent. With heavy use of 2+ hrs of Instagram scrolling 1+ hr of YouTube streaming 2+ hrs of listening to music, battery lasts for a whole day. With moderate use for only calling, texting & some surfing it lasts for 1 & 1/2 day.Camera- amazing shots in daylight. Night mode is great addition. Portrait mode is great in daytime but it doesn't have night mode. Photos loose details after zooming in. Upto 2x zoom is good, after that it's useless.Ultrawide feature is good but didn't used it much. Front camera is okay, could have been better.Performance- Ultrafast & smooth. It had heated a lot when moving data from older phone. Heats when used during charging. Fast charger does its job well.Conclusion- This is a great iPhone but is not a value for money. Overpriced! We can say this about every iPhone. If you are spending this much amount of money you should go for iPhone 12 128GB for about same price but with only 2 snappers which are more than enough. Third snapper in 11 pro doesn't make a difference.If you are waiting for iPhone 13 to be launched & thinking of buying 12 after price drop, then consider iPhone 11 for now - 2 snappers, LCD display(not much different), bigger than pro, value for money.Thanks for reading.\n",

      "Short: Go for it if you can afford.TL;DR;I've been having Apple ecosystem (MBP, Watch, AirPod, iPad and iPhone) for many years.  However, this is my first release day purchase of an Apple device.  Improved camera module in iPhone 11 pro helped me to arrive at this decision and I believe that this is the single most important feature in iPhone 11 pro.  Mainly -- Introduction of new wide angle lens.- Better color reproduction- Night mode (Some online reviews suggested that this can not be changed and is set by Camera app automatically.  This is not true.  You can disable if needed from the selection controls)- 16:9 format (you can set this to default from Settings->Camera->Preserve Settings->Camera Mode).  This is the default in my case- Portrait mode with light settings.  I found that we can take studio quality pictures using this)Here are some images I took at various settings.  You can see the richness of color in each of these photographs.  The first one was in the morning against rising sun.  Look at the accurate exposure on the lawn even with the presence of direct sunlight.  The last one is part of Blue city Jodhpur with Mehrangarh fort in the backdrop.  Though the blue is a bit saturated, it gives a dramatic look for the photos.In addition to Camera, the overall experience is very fluid and effortless (I'm leaving out the iOS13 features as the same is available on older models as well).There are a few drawbacks though. The phone is bit bulkier than previous models.  The advantage is the increased battery life.  I've been able to use the phone for upto 30 hours with over 4 hours of screen time (mainly reading and videos) and close to 1 hour of call.  That's a great improvement compared to previous versions.The second drawback is the price.  But that's the price you pay for quality.  One should be able to use this phone for 4 years at least with OS upgrades and Security updates coming in continuously (Something which I don't see on Android).\n",

      "What I love:1. Amazing battery life - lasts me 1.5 days from full charge2. Great speaker quality3. Superb camera - night mode comes on automatically with the option to control shutter speed4. Form factor - love the small form factor5. Superb display6. Fast charging - so used to this coming from my OnePlus 6T7. Face ID works flawlessly - the fingerprint scanner in my OP6T didn't work most of the time.What I don't like:1. No USB-C - this is a major pain since the supplied charger and earphones only need to be lightning port compatible. Can't use any other charger or earphone. Luckily I have my Sony headphones which I use with Bluetooth2. Flimsy quality of the charger wire - feels too fragile - should have been metal sheathed and strong.3. Flimsy quality of the earphone wire4. Price5. Lack of good usability of apps - e.g. no way to mark Messages as 'read' from the notifications center. You need to clear the notifications, then go to Messaging app and open each and every message. Considering that most messages are OTPs, etc. this functionality should be a no-brainer.Overall, I love the phone.\n",

      "Bought this online on 21st October 2019.Sold by Appario and fulfilled by Amazon. The product dispatch and delivery was prompt. Full marks there.A year later, I have noticed that the battery performance is unimpressive on two frontsa) Takes longer to charge than what it shouldb) The phone lasts fewer hours (irrespective of whether in use or idle).The phone-build is commendable and has sustained a few falls.Clearly the chip design is impressive too. I tested this by using my phone as a hotspot, and performed a speed test. I then moved the SIM card to a router and then performed a speed test. Results were contrasting and clearly in favor of the iphone.However, these arent reasons good enough to shell out close to 1 lac INR for a phone, if the expected service duration without issues is just about a year.\n",

      "The best looking phone. I have been an android user for over 9 years and this is my first purchase of iOS. It took me some time to adjust to the know how of iOS but I can happily say that the switch was worth. This phone is miles ahead of even the flagships introduced in late 2020 or early 2021. The camera is a big improvement on this. My previous phone was pixel 2 XL and this seems to have a improved camera over that.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase and stick to this for the next 4 years at least as 5G in India is going to be a distant dream when it Comes to being implemented in all cities.\n",

      "Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 2 April 2021Verified Purchase\n",
      "I'm writing this review after 1 month of use.Look & feel- premium & satisfyingDisplay- It has OLED display but not much different than previous LCD display of iPhone XR. BOTH ARE STUNNING & elegant. In fact I liked LCD display more.Battery life- Excellent. With heavy use of 2+ hrs of Instagram scrolling 1+ hr of YouTube streaming 2+ hrs of listening to music, battery lasts for a whole day. With moderate use for only calling, texting & some surfing it lasts for 1 & 1/2 day.Camera- amazing shots in daylight. Night mode is great addition. Portrait mode is great in daytime but it doesn't have night mode. Photos loose details after zooming in. Upto 2x zoom is good, after that it's useless.Ultrawide feature is good but didn't used it much. Front camera is okay, could have been better.Performance- Ultrafast & smooth. It had heated a lot when moving data from older phone. Heats when used during charging. Fast charger does its job well.Conclusion- This is a great iPhone but is not a value for money. Overpriced! We can say this about every iPhone. If you are spending this much amount of money you should go for iPhone 12 128GB for about same price but with only 2 snappers which are more than enough. Third snapper in 11 pro doesn't make a difference.If you are waiting for iPhone 13 to be launched & thinking of buying 12 after price drop, then consider iPhone 11 for now - 2 snappers, LCD display(not much different), bigger than pro, value for money.Thanks for reading.\n",

      "Short: Go for it if you can afford.TL;DR;I've been having Apple ecosystem (MBP, Watch, AirPod, iPad and iPhone) for many years.  However, this is my first release day purchase of an Apple device.  Improved camera module in iPhone 11 pro helped me to arrive at this decision and I believe that this is the single most important feature in iPhone 11 pro.  Mainly -- Introduction of new wide angle lens.- Better color reproduction- Night mode (Some online reviews suggested that this can not be changed and is set by Camera app automatically.  This is not true.  You can disable if needed from the selection controls)- 16:9 format (you can set this to default from Settings->Camera->Preserve Settings->Camera Mode).  This is the default in my case- Portrait mode with light settings.  I found that we can take studio quality pictures using this)Here are some images I took at various settings.  You can see the richness of color in each of these photographs.  The first one was in the morning against rising sun.  Look at the accurate exposure on the lawn even with the presence of direct sunlight.  The last one is part of Blue city Jodhpur with Mehrangarh fort in the backdrop.  Though the blue is a bit saturated, it gives a dramatic look for the photos.In addition to Camera, the overall experience is very fluid and effortless (I'm leaving out the iOS13 features as the same is available on older models as well).There are a few drawbacks though. The phone is bit bulkier than previous models.  The advantage is the increased battery life.  I've been able to use the phone for upto 30 hours with over 4 hours of screen time (mainly reading and videos) and close to 1 hour of call.  That's a great improvement compared to previous versions.The second drawback is the price.  But that's the price you pay for quality.  One should be able to use this phone for 4 years at least with OS upgrades and Security updates coming in continuously (Something which I don't see on Android).\n",

      "Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 13 March 2020Verified Purchase\n",
      "What I love:1. Amazing battery life - lasts me 1.5 days from full charge2. Great speaker quality3. Superb camera - night mode comes on automatically with the option to control shutter speed4. Form factor - love the small form factor5. Superb display6. Fast charging - so used to this coming from my OnePlus 6T7. Face ID works flawlessly - the fingerprint scanner in my OP6T didn't work most of the time.What I don't like:1. No USB-C - this is a major pain since the supplied charger and earphones only need to be lightning port compatible. Can't use any other charger or earphone. Luckily I have my Sony headphones which I use with Bluetooth2. Flimsy quality of the charger wire - feels too fragile - should have been metal sheathed and strong.3. Flimsy quality of the earphone wire4. Price5. Lack of good usability of apps - e.g. no way to mark Messages as 'read' from the notifications center. You need to clear the notifications, then go to Messaging app and open each and every message. Considering that most messages are OTPs, etc. this functionality should be a no-brainer.Overall, I love the phone.\n",

      "Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 30 September 2020Verified Purchase\n",
      "Bought this online on 21st October 2019.Sold by Appario and fulfilled by Amazon. The product dispatch and delivery was prompt. Full marks there.A year later, I have noticed that the battery performance is unimpressive on two frontsa) Takes longer to charge than what it shouldb) The phone lasts fewer hours (irrespective of whether in use or idle).The phone-build is commendable and has sustained a few falls.Clearly the chip design is impressive too. I tested this by using my phone as a hotspot, and performed a speed test. I then moved the SIM card to a router and then performed a speed test. Results were contrasting and clearly in favor of the iphone.However, these arent reasons good enough to shell out close to 1 lac INR for a phone, if the expected service duration without issues is just about a year.\n",

      "The best looking phone. I have been an android user for over 9 years and this is my first purchase of iOS. It took me some time to adjust to the know how of iOS but I can happily say that the switch was worth. This phone is miles ahead of even the flagships introduced in late 2020 or early 2021. The camera is a big improvement on this. My previous phone was pixel 2 XL and this seems to have a improved camera over that.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase and stick to this for the next 4 years at least as 5G in India is going to be a distant dream when it Comes to being implemented in all cities.\n",
